 1. Introduction
 Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, with early detection playing a crucial role
 in improving patient outcomes. 
Traditional diagnostic methods rely on clinical assessments, which can be time-consuming and
 subject to human error. Advances in data 
science and artificial intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity to enhance stroke detection through
 machine learning (ML) models. This 
proposal outlines an AI-driven approach to stroke detection, leveraging medical data to improve
 accuracy and speed in diagnosis.
 2. Problem Statement
 Current stroke detection methods face challenges, including delays in diagnosis and high
 false-negative rates. According to the World 
Health Organization (WHO), strokes account for over 12% of deaths globally. Early and accurate
 detection can significantly reduce mortality 
rates and improve treatment effectiveness. However, conventional methods often struggle with:
- Subjectivity in diagnosis- Variability in clinical assessments- High dependence on specialized medical professionals
 3. Proposed Solution
 To address these challenges, this project proposes developing a machine learning model capable of
 detecting strokes from patient health 
records and demographic data. The proposed solution will:- Utilize ML techniques for structured data analysis- Leverage patient demographic and clinical data for predictive modeling- Employ explainable AI (XAI) methods to ensure transparency and trust in the model's decisions
 4. Methodology
 4.1 Data Collection- Data Sources: Public datasets (e.g., Kaggle Stroke Prediction Dataset), hospital medical records- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data normalization, feature selection
 4.2 Model Development- Machine Learning Techniques:
  - Classical models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression for structured data- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC for performance assessment
 4.3 Model Validation & Deployment- Validation: Cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness- Deployment: Cloud-based API integration for real-time stroke detection- Interpretability: SHAP values and LIME for model explainability
5. Expected Outcomes- Enhanced accuracy in stroke detection compared to conventional methods- Faster diagnosis, leading to improved patient outcomes- Integration potential with hospital systems for real-time analysis
 6. Risk Assessment & Mitigation- Data Bias & Imbalance: Addressed using oversampling, synthetic data augmentation- Regulatory Compliance: Ensure adherence to HIPAA, GDPR for data privacy- Model Interpretability: Utilize XAI techniques to build trust with medical professionals
 7. Conclusion
 This proposal presents an AI-driven approach to stroke detection that aims to enhance early
 diagnosis accuracy and speed. By leveraging 
machine learning techniques and explainable AI, this project seeks to provide a scalable and
 effective solution for real-world medical 
applications, ultimately improving stroke patient outcomes and reducing healthcare burdens.
